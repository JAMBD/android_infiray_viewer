# Third party andoid app for Infiray thermal cameras

An implementation of a UVC camera app specific to the Infiray P2Pro thermal camera.

Current features:
* Views the YUV422 stream.
* Saves the YUV422 stream as a .png into a photo album.
* Saves the whole frame (including the 16bit image) into the Downloads folder.
* Send control transfers to the camera that changes the colour scheme.

Thanks to Peter-St for having an app on the playstore that proved my device can operate on my phone.
